The AaRC community aims to bring together early career researchers applying genomic approaches to ancient animal remains and nucleotide-preserving material. 

By providing an inclusive environment, AaRC will promote knowledge exchange and collaboration between researchers regardless of their institutional or disciplinary background; facilitate the establishment of community-led standards, best practices and resources; and provide a platform for the sharing of research and knowledge. 

AaRC is envisioned to be primarily run by and for early career researchers (graduate student, post-doctoral researchers, and early group leaders), but researchers of all career stages are welcome to join and participate in the community.

AaRC's mission is to provide:

- Scientific advancement (via community-driven projects to advance the field)
- Training and support (through resources and courses to facilitate knowledge sharing and quality of research)
- Networking (by facilitating collaborations and assisting each other)

for the animal ancient DNA community.

We achieve these aims with various [projects](/AaRC.github.io/projects), and by regularly communciating with each other.

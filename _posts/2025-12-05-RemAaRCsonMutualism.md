After the success of last year's Quagga Qonference, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the first animal aDNA publication, we wanted to continue offering a space for stablished researchers to 
discuss in depth on the wider topics they focus their research. This lead to the creation of RemAaRCs, an annual space for those kinds of seminars in our mostly ECR-focused annual line-up. 
And we are really happy to start with two amazing speakers on a really important topic: Mutualism.

- Yvette Running Horse Collin (Taku Skan Skan Wasakliyapi, Global Insitute for Traditional Sciences)
- Ron Dunn (North Carolina State University)

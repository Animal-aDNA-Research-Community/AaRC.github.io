We are happy to announce that the AaRC Steering Committee has changed its composition. Four new members have been added to the engagement team after the open 
call for candidates, all with interesting proposals for the future of AaRC. The new members are:

* Katia Bougiouri - GLOBE Institute, University of Copenhagen
* Emilio MÃ¡rmol - GLOBE Institute, University of Copenhagen
* Lachie Scarsbrook - School of Archaeology, University of Oxford
* Eleanor Green - Department of Archaeology, University of York

Edana has decided to step down from her role as Treasurer as she is moving towards a new position more focused on plant. From all the members of 
the Steering Committee and we hope from all the AaRC community, we want to thank her for her work and wish her the best on her new position. 

The role of Treasurer will be shared by a new Treasury Team, which right now is formed by Laura and Victoria.

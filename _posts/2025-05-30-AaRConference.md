Join us online for our AaRConference 
In celebration of a year of AaRC we will be running a half day conference. 
We are fortunate to welcome our invited speakers **Laurent Frantz** (LMU) and **Evon Hekkala** (Fordham University).

The conference will consist on two sessions of two hours with an introduction by one of our invited speakers and then four 12 minute talks plus three minutes for questions.


Abstract submission can be done [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGbAm1nZor7ST-4S_VlzCgoEGlRW1fRgRmahXQq2zELhdyng/viewform). 

A detailed program will be shared once submissions have been reviewed.

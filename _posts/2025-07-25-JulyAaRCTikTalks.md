This month our AaRCTikTalks bring us 2 awesome talks from the land down under: 
* A.B. Siegenthaler - Do sleeping "dogs" lie? Reexamining claims for early domestic dog derived from burial contexts.
* Clàudia Fontserè Alemany - Temporal dynamics of genomic erosion after demographic rescue: Insights from the Whooping Cranes.

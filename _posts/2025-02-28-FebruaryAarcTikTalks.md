This month our AaRCTikTalks go to the museum to show us how museomics can contribute to aDNA research: 
* Alexander Salis (American Museum of Natural History) will introduce us to the huge potential of museum collections as a source of genetic data.
* Anna Penna (Lund University) will showcase how she used museum samples for conservation genetics of a cryptic nocturnal primate.

As with previous AaRCTikTalks, you can register to the seminar mailing list [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfq4BUmArgA96iWjm71ocQwbosLZRNb72rZK8Oky1RCnJsGNw/viewform)
or join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/aarc-8tg1497/shared_invite/zt-2evac9tqu-GXoU0UsmLbI4mIsS91XMcw), where a link will be shared minutes before it starts.

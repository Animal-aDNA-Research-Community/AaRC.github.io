This month our AaRCTikTalks bring us two incredibly talented researchers: 
* Oph√©lie Lebrasseur (University of Oxford) will bring us to East Asia, where chicken was first domesticated, and we will follow her on these new chicken's journey
to South America.
* Marianne Dehasque (Uppsala University) will tell us the history of Lonely Boy and the last woolly mammoths of Wrangel island.

Hi everybody! We are happy to announce that we have a new domain name for this website. You can still use the old github pages link and it will still redirect you here, but now you can use the more convenient [www.animal-adna.org](https://www.animal-adna.org/) to find us. 

This change is also impotant since it will allow us to fix some issues with the site template we were using. This means you can expect to see news, events and blogs appearing now on our landing page and the respetive sections on the webpage. This also means we are going to start publishing every activity we organize here from now on, so the website is going to be quite active!

This November 15th is the anniversary of the first ancient DNA paper, published that day of 1984 in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/312282a0). This publication kickstarted aDNA research, and highlights the 
critical role animal aDNA has played in the development of paleogenomics as a whole. To celebrate this role, discuss the actual state of the field and what the future may bring us we will have talks by Selina Brace, 
Robert C. Fleischer and Ludovic Orlando.

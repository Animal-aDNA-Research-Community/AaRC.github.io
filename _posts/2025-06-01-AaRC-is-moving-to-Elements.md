### IMPORTANT:

As other ancient biomolecule communities, AaRC is moving from Slack to Element (Matrix). 

The transition from Slack to Elements will take a month, in which news will be posted in both platforms, starting on June 1st. After July 1st AaRC's steering committee will stop posting on Slack any news, 
links to the seminars, etc. From that moment, Slack will be kept for archival purposes only, and after three months all messages will be unaccessible. 

AaRC's team will try to make the transition as easy as posible.

You can find our AaRC space [here](https://matrix.to/#/#aarc:archaeo.social).

Please, follow [this link](https://www.isbarch.org/chat) for more information and instructions on how to create your account on Elements.

See you there!

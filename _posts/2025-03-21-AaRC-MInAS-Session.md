AaRC members!

Have your say in the development of ancient DNA metadata standards on 21 March 2025 at 14:00 CET on Zoom (link to be shared closer to the time).

**Background:** The [MInAS project](https://www.mixs-minas.org/) (Minimum Information about any Ancient Sequence) aims to develop standardised metadata reporting schemes of ancient DNA samples and sequencing data via community-based consensus and training. But in order to develop these schemes we need as much community input as possible. We are a diverse research community and you will be the end-user.

**Session info:** In this feedback session we want to get YOUR perspectives and contributions to making a field-wide reporting standard! During the session we will introduce the project, after which you will have the opportunity to fill out the draft MInAS metadata checklist we have been developing, using on your own material. This is your chance to provide input, contribute and make sure the standards also fit YOUR research!

**What we need from you:** Join us on 21 March 2025 at 14:00 Central European Time on Zoom (link to be distributed on the AaRC Slack channel) and please bring information about two of your samples (published or unpublished) to test our metadata schemes. The session will last 2-3 hours.

**What you can get:** Everyone who contributes feedback during the workshop will be eligible for co-authorship on future publications linked to the MInAS project.

We hope to see many of you on 21 March 2025 at 14:00 CET!

Your hosts,

Deon and Oph√©lie

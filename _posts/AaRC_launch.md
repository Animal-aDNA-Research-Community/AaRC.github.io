### The Animal aDNA Research Community starts officially on April 2024.
After several months of working in the shadows, AaRC is now open and working to create posibilities for Early-Career researchers (ECRs) working on animal ancient genomics and related fields to network, discuss, interact and disseminate their awesome work. 

With this goal in mind, we have organized a series of *monthly seminars* where ECRs will present their recent and exiting results. The first session is on the XX of April, and anyone interested can register [here](link_to_google_form). 

If you want to participate in the community, please go to our [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/aarc-8tg1497/shared_invite/zt-2evac9tqu-GXoU0UsmLbI4mIsS91XMcw) or join our [mailing list](link_to_mailing_list)

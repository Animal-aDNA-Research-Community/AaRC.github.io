This month our AaRCTikTalks bring us 2 awesome talks: 
* Ana Mar√≠a Agapito Vera (Zurich University) will tell us about her research on the conservation of Orangutans using museomics and shallow sequencing.
* Paige Byerly (Senckenberg Centre for Wildlife Genetics) will showcase the power of museomics as a tool for conservation of endangered bird species.

Join us in beautiful Torino, Italy, in our event Boarding the AaRC. As an ISBA associated community, AaRC will be at ISBA2025, where we will be having an special event on August 26th (2:30-4:30 CET). 
The main goal of this event is to allow people who didn't got a full talk to present their research/promote their posters about animal paleogenetics, but we will also have some interesting round tables 
and networking before going to the conference welcome cocktail. 

If this sounds interesting to you, come and join us at Aula C, Via Albertina 13. No registration needed!

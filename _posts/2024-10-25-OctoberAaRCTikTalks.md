As October gets to an end we'll have another instalment of our #AaRCTikTalks. This time, we'll have Gözde Atag (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology) and Connor Rossi (Trinity College Dublin).
Connor will walk us through his work on the demographic and evolutionary history of aurochs (Bos primigenius), while Gözde will show use preliminary results on faunal remains in human burials. 

As with previous AaRCTikTalks, you can register to the seminar mailing list [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfq4BUmArgA96iWjm71ocQwbosLZRNb72rZK8Oky1RCnJsGNw/viewform)
or join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/aarc-8tg1497/shared_invite/zt-2evac9tqu-GXoU0UsmLbI4mIsS91XMcw), where a link will be shared minutes before it starts.

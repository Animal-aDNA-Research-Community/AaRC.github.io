# Sustainable ancestral fisheries across millennia

Vancouver is currently the major city across the Canadian Pacific coast, and the third biggest urban area in Canada after Toronto and Montreal. Located along the Burrard Peninsula, it lies between the Burrard Inlet and Frasier River, isolated from the Pacific Ocean by the Vancouver Island. This environment creates a privileged ecosystem that has been exploited for millennia by human settlements1, first by Native ancestral cultures with recorded archaeological evidence dating back several thousand years, followed by European exploration during the late XVIII and early XIX centuries, and subsequent colonial urbanization during the late XIX century leading to a quick growth and industrial development.  With about than 2.5 million inhabitants in its metropolitan area, it is currently one of the busiest port cities in North America, comprising a melting pot of diverse cultures and ethnicities, and a leading multibillion economy based on Port trades, forestry and mining activities, but also with an active development in software, biotechnology and aerospace industries.
As a modern developed and vibrant cosmopolitan area, human urbanism and economic activities have made a huge impact in the surrounding ecosystem, with the loss of multiple local habitats and animal and plant populations that once thrived in the region. Back before European colonization, the scenery was radically different: What is now known as the Burrard Inlet was then called səlilwət, a territory of the Tsleil-Waututh community, and Indigenous Coast Salish culture that settled and lived along those inlet coastlines for millennia1,2. Central to the Tsleil-Waututh society was the fishing and harvesting of shellfish, as a way of sustaining a diet comprising salmon, herring, waterfowl, and clams, with berries, plant foods, fruits, deer, ling cod, anchovy, eulachon, and halibut, among others. From these, salmon consumption and its transformation for long storage was a key resource, with an estimate of around 300-350 kg consumed per person per year, thus allowing permanent settlements year-round.

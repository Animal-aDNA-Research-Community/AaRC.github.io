This month our AaRCTikTalks bring us 2 awesome talks: 
* Lydia Hildebrand Furness (University of Oslo) will explain to us how Dugon populations are structured around the Indo-Pacific.
* Lachi Scarsbrook (University of Oxford) will showcase his work exploring the history of palaeolothic domestic dogs.

Are you starting to work on aDNA? Are you familiar with genomics but would like to get to know how to work with degraded, low-quality genomic data?
Come and join us in the first installment of AaRC's workshop series! 
These workshops, aimed to provide hands-on approaches for people to get familiar with paleogenomics are online and free of charge!
So please, join us and Nikolay Oskolkov (Lund University) on October 7th, 14:00, to learn how to properly process your ancient, degraded data.

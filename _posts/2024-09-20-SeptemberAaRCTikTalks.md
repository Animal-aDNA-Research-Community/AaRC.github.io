We are reaching the end of September, and that means next week we will have our monthly seminar. 
This month we have Pablo Librado, from the Institut de Biologia Evolutiva of the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona and 
Jolijn Erven, from the Groningen Institute of Archaeology of the University of Groningen, will talk about their work on 
the elusive domestication of modern horses and how we can impute ancient cattle genomes using a set of modern samples. 

As with previous AaRCTikTalks, you can register to the seminar mailing list [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfq4BUmArgA96iWjm71ocQwbosLZRNb72rZK8Oky1RCnJsGNw/viewform)
or join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/aarc-8tg1497/shared_invite/zt-2evac9tqu-GXoU0UsmLbI4mIsS91XMcw), where a link will be shared minutes before it starts.

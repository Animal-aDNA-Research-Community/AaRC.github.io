This month our AaRCTikTalks make us travel to the Americas with: 
* Maria Zikos (Natural History Museum), who will show us her work on Darwin Ground Sloths (Mylodon darwinii) from Chile.
* Jesse Morin (Simon Fraser University), who has been investigating the Pre-Contact salmon fisheries of the Coast Salish and how First Nations exploited them.

As with previous AaRCTikTalks, you can register to the seminar mailing list [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfq4BUmArgA96iWjm71ocQwbosLZRNb72rZK8Oky1RCnJsGNw/viewform)
or join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/aarc-8tg1497/shared_invite/zt-2evac9tqu-GXoU0UsmLbI4mIsS91XMcw), where a link will be shared minutes before it starts.
